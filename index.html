            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Samuele, but I often go by my nickname, <em>Chamered</em>. I was born in 2005 and I'm currently in my first year of the Bachelor's program
                in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.unibz.it">unibz</a>. I'm really passionate about programming, especially when it comes to developing video games.
                In my free time, I also enjoy playing music and, of course, gaming.
            </p>

            <h3>Projects</h3>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Guess the Code</strong> - A little game made in java where the player need to guess a randomly generated code made of 4 characters in 20 attempts. At each guess a feedback is given.
                        This project was made as part of the exam of the introduction to programming course and you can look at the it <a href="https://github.com/chamered/guess-the-code">here</a>.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Chess</strong> - I am currently working with my team at creating chess (vs a bot) in java as project for the programming course. After the development, the repository
                        will become public and you will be able to take a look at it here.
